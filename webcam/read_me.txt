Webcam Viewer - Quick Guide

Getting Started
1) Unzip the supplied folder to a place you know (for example, Desktop or Documents). Keep all the files together in that folder. You should see at least: index.html and script.js.

2) Open index.html
   - Double-click index.html to open it in your browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge recommended).
   - When the browser asks for permission to use your camera, click Allow.
   - If you do not see your camera, click the small camera icon near the address bar and choose Allow, then reload the page.

What You Can Do (Top Bar)
- Rotate 90°: Each click turns the video by 90° (0° → 90° → 180° → 270° → 0°). Use this to correct orientation.

- Autofocus (if shown): Turns auto focusing on or off. If you do not see this option, your camera does not support it in the browser.

- Lock Focus (if shown): Freezes the focus where it is so it does not keep hunting.

- Focus slider (if shown): Lets you manually adjust focus when Autofocus is off. Only available on some cameras.

- Zoom: Move the slider to zoom in and out.
  - On some cameras this is real camera zoom.
  - On others, the page zooms the picture for you (digital zoom).
  - Reset Zoom puts the picture back to normal and recenters it.

- Drag to pan (when zoomed in): Click and drag (or touch and drag) the video to look around. You cannot drag past the edges.
 
- Full Screen button: Click to make the video fill the whole screen. Click again (or press F11) to exit full screen.

Tip
- Full screen: Press F11 to make the browser window full screen. Press F11 again to exit.

Notes About Cameras and Browsers
- Logitech C922: Autofocus usually works in Chrome/Edge. Manual focus may or may not be available. Zoom is usually digital only.
- Other webcams: Some support real zoom; many laptop webcams are fixed-focus and will not show focus controls.
- Browsers: Chrome/Edge on Windows tend to support the most features. Safari/Firefox may show fewer options.

If Something Is Not Working
- No picture or black screen: Make sure no other app (Teams, Zoom, Skype) is using the camera. Close them and refresh the page.
- Permission blocked: Click the camera icon near the address bar and set the camera permission to Allow, then reload.
- Wrong camera: Use the browser camera icon to switch the device, then reload.
- Zoom does nothing: Your camera may not support real zoom. Try the slider again; the page will use digital zoom.

Files Included
- index.html: The main page and controls.
- script.js: The code that starts the camera and runs the features.
